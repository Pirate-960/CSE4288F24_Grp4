    "### 1. **Introduction to Decision Trees**\n",
    "Decision trees are among the simplest and most interpretable machine learning algorithms. They are **supervised learning algorithms**, meaning they require labeled data to learn. The goal is to partition the data into subsets based on feature values to make predictions, which can either be categorical (classification) or continuous (regression).\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees are also a type of **non-parametric** model, which means they do not make strong assumptions about the form of the relationship between the features and the target variable. This gives them the flexibility to model complex, non-linear relationships between the input features and the output prediction.\n",

    "A decision tree can be thought of as a flowchart-like structure. The decision-making process can be visualized as a series of **questions** about the data that ultimately lead to a **final decision**. The structure consists of:\n",
    "- **Root Node**: The topmost node, representing the entire dataset. The root node is where the decision tree begins its classification or regression task.\n",
    "- **Internal Nodes**: Intermediate nodes that represent decision points, where the data is split based on feature values. Each internal node contains a condition that partitions the data into two or more subsets.\n",
    "- **Leaf Nodes**: Terminal nodes that represent the final decision or prediction. In classification, these nodes contain the predicted class label, while in regression, they contain the predicted value.\n",

    "### 3. **How Decision Trees Work**\n",
    "Decision trees work by recursively splitting the dataset into smaller and smaller subsets, based on the feature that provides the best split at each step. This process is repeated for each subset until certain stopping criteria are met.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Selecting Features for Splitting**: At each internal node, the algorithm evaluates all possible features and selects the one that best splits the data. The feature chosen minimizes the **impurity** (for classification) or **error** (for regression).\n",
    "- **Recursive Splitting**: This process of feature selection and splitting is done recursively, creating a tree-like structure. For each node, the algorithm evaluates possible splits and continues until:\n",
    "  - The node reaches a stopping criterion (e.g., max depth, minimum samples in a node, or pure node).\n",
    "  - The data at the node is homogeneous (all data points in the node belong to the same class or have the same target value).\n",

    "### 4. **Splitting Criteria**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.1 **Gini Impurity (for Classification)**\n",
    "Gini Impurity is a popular metric for determining the quality of splits in classification tasks. It measures the probability of misclassifying a randomly chosen element in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explanation**: The Gini Impurity calculates the probability that two randomly selected samples from the node will belong to different classes. A Gini Impurity of 0 means the node is pure (all samples belong to the same class), while higher values indicate more mixed classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision tree algorithm splits the data at each internal node in such a way that the resulting child nodes have a lower Gini Impurity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.2 **Entropy and Information Gain (for Classification)**\n",
    "Entropy measures the amount of uncertainty or disorder within a dataset. It is used to calculate **Information Gain**, which indicates the reduction in entropy after a split.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explanation of Entropy**: Entropy is a measure of the disorder or unpredictability in the dataset. A node with high entropy means that the samples in that node are equally distributed across the classes, indicating high uncertainty. A node with low entropy indicates less disorder and higher purity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Information Gain** is the reduction in entropy after splitting a node based on a feature. The algorithm will choose the feature that maximizes the Information Gain, as it reduces the uncertainty in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.3 **Mean Squared Error (MSE) (for Regression)**\n",
    "For regression tasks, where the target variable is continuous, decision trees use **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** to evaluate splits. The objective is to minimize the variance within the resulting subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explanation**: The MSE measures the average squared difference between the actual values and the predicted values. A lower MSE means that the predictions are closer to the actual values, indicating a better model fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each node, the decision tree algorithm splits the data in such a way that the MSE is minimized, and the resulting child nodes have as little variation as possible.\n",

    "### 5. **Stopping Criteria**\n",
    "The process of growing a decision tree is stopped when certain stopping criteria are met:\n",
    "1. **Maximum Depth**: Limiting the maximum depth of the tree can prevent overfitting, ensuring that the tree does not become overly complex and capture noise in the data.\n",
    "2. **Minimum Samples per Split**: The tree may stop growing if a node has fewer than a specified number of samples, as further splits would not improve the model significantly.\n",
    "3. **Pure Node**: If a node contains only data points from a single class (for classification) or a constant value (for regression), the tree will stop splitting further, as the node is \"pure.\"\n",
    "4. **Maximum Number of Nodes or Leaves**: The tree may be pruned or cut off after a certain number of leaves or nodes.\n",
    "5. **Insufficient Gain**: If the feature split does not significantly reduce the impurity or error, the algorithm may stop splitting further.\n",

    "Pruning is a technique to remove branches or nodes that add little predictive power to the model. It is used to **avoid overfitting** and **improve generalization**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of pruning:\n",
    "- **Pre-pruning**: The tree is constrained during its growth to limit its complexity. This is done by setting limits on the depth, number of nodes, or minimum samples per node.\n",
    "- **Post-pruning**: The tree is allowed to grow fully, and then branches that do not significantly improve the modelâ€™s performance (often based on a validation dataset) are removed.\n",

    "- **Sensitive to Small Changes**: Small changes in the data can cause the decision tree to split differently, leading to instability in the model.\n",
    "- **Bias Toward Features with More Levels**: Decision trees may be biased toward features with more categories or values, especially in classification tasks with categorical data.\n",
